Twenty years ago, people              could perhaps imagine that climate change was not a real problem, because             some 
scientists still had doubts.  Today almost             all the world's scientists agree: the world is getting hotter, and it is the 
fault of human beings. Our planet is going            towards a climate catastrophe, but we can stop its worst effects. 
Indeed we must do everything possible to stop them.
 In November 2021, world leaders (or most of them) met        in Glasgow, in Scotland, for the COP26 summit. They     
took quite a few decisions, to          try and stop the Earth getting       too warm! Many countries promised to become 
"carbon neutral" before 2050. Some have promised to become carbon-neutral even faster. World leaders       agree 
that we have to stop using coal and oil to generate              heat and electricity; we should use green energy sources 
instead, known as "renewables."
Before the year 2100, all the energy             that we use may perhaps come from  renewable sources; the sun, the sea, 
the wind and rivers can produce more       than enough energy for everyone on our planet, but we still have a long way 
to go.
